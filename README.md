# A Computer is a mathematical construct
there aee certain Biological processes whose systemic behavior resembles a discrete function expressed as a multitude of 
discrete anaalogues. there are certain Biological transformstions that are recipes.
when we describe them as repeated steps we simolify the complexxity of describing them.
This provides a way to manage large processes which varied molecular outcome, as a 
copy of another analof system.

# Biological Problems
For the time being, it has been quite difficult to find examples ... hardline which indicate the difference between solvable on unsolvable prolems with Biology because these problems are assumed to have limited quantitative information about them. This is incorrect. There is a lot of really good research on Biological problems which would constitute an open discussion for solutions.
