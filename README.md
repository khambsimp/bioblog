# Bioblog
This README describes areas of ongoing Biological Research, where applied discrete mathematics 
is beneficial to the analysis and categorization of tissue.

Bioblog Blog was initiated as an Open Source store for Applied Biological Research. 

The intent of this repositofy being this research could influence a number of Scintific fields
including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, X-Ray, Computed Tomography even Ultrasound.

In each application mentioned previously, it is apparent that there are Discrete
Structures in the formulation of Biological and Chemical processes. Even in an
algebraic, or algorithmic sense, being able to represent a number of these
processes symbolically really simplifies the visual illustration a Graphical Software 
could generate.

# Automata
Discrete Mathematics, and Discrete Structures can be theorized, or assumed across 
a number of geometric, or framework dependent objects. These could be graphs, 
automata, machines, written language, or even biology. Now, Automata, specifically 
are paricularly suited to modeling biology. 

# A Computer is a mathematical construct
There are certain Biological processes whose systemic behavior resembles a
discrete function expressed as a multitude of discrete analogues. There are
certain Biological transformations that are recipes. When we describe them as
repeated steps we simplify the complexity of describing them. This provides a
way to manage large processes with varied molecular outcomes, as a copy of
another analog system.

# Biological Problems
Here are some really good examples: . The aim of bioblog is to present the
extrapolation for large scale discrete analysis applied in a biological context.
 Many reoccurring patterns within Data Analysis are actually formulations of
 underlying algorithms. Because algorithms can be specified
and categorized in much more efficient systems today, versus in the past, it
stands that there are also many more opportunities to simplify the analysis of
 large swathes of biological data.  

These problems are assumed to have limited quantitative
information about them. This is incorrect. There is a lot of really good
research on Biological problems which would constitute an open discussion
representing biological and chemical processes as individual discrete systems.
