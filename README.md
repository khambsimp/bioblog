# Bioblog
This README describes the blog initiation for blog on Open Source applications
of Biological Research Devices. These could be based on Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance, X-Ray, Computed Tomography or even Ultrasound. In each instance
mentioned previously. It is apparent that there are Discrete Structures in the
formulation of Biological and Chemical processes. Even in an algebraic, or
algorithmic sense, being able to represent a number of these processes
symbolically really simplifies the visual illustration the Software graphics
are generating.

# A Computer is a mathematical construct
There are certain Biological processes whose systemic behavior resembles a
discrete function expressed as a multitude of discrete analogues. There are
certain Biological transformations that are recipes. When we describe them as
repeated steps we simplify the complexity of describing them. This provides a
way to manage large processes with varied molecular outcomes, as a copy of
another analog system.

# Biological Problems
Here are some really good examples: . The aim of bioblog is to present the
extrapolation for large scale discrete analysis applied in a biological context.
 Many reoccurring patterns within Data Analysis are actually formulations of
 underlying algorithms. Because algorithms can be specified
and categorized in much more efficient systems today, versus in the past, it
stands that there are also many more opportunities to simplify the analysis of
 large swathes of biological data.  

These problems are assumed to have limited quantitative
information about them. This is incorrect. There is a lot of really good
research on Biological problems which would constitute an open discussion
representing biological and chemical processes as individual discrete systems.
